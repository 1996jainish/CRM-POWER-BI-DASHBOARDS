### Info :

This dashboard is designed for sales managers to track their team's quarterly performance. To get started, select your name from the filter on the current quarter performance tab. This will populate all pages of the dashboard with your team's information. If you'd like to view another team's information, you can simply change the name selected in the filter and everything will update accordingly.

The dashboard is interactive, so more information may appear as you move your mouse across the visuals, and clicking on visuals may perform actions. For example, clicking on a visual may filter the other visuals on the page to the item you have clicked on (click a second time to de-select it), or clicking on the buttons across all pages will help you navigate the dashboard.

The report is filtered to the last quarter, however if you'd like to view previous quarter performance you can visit the performance over time page. You can also visit the performance by team page to see how your team is comparing across the broader business on key business metrics

To learn how the dashboard metrics were calculated, view below, otherwise close this box to get started.
